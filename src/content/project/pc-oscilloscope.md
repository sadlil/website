A computer based Oscilloscope simulation program. Shows the output of an oscillating AC circuit's in computer monitor with an JavaSE based Application. An circuit capture the oscillating power and the interpret it and then send it to the JavaSE application via USB. The Java Desktop application shows the changing graph in the computer monitor.
This is an cost efficient and safe implementation of Real Oscilloscope Device. It also included various feature like saving and printing the output directly.
